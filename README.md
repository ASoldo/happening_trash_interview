## My Disastrous Interview Experience with Happening
I recently had the misfortune of interviewing for a Senior Full Stack Developer position at Happening. The role was advertised as a Vue + NestJS project, but the reality was far from what was promised.

## False Advertising
Upon starting the interview, I quickly realized that the project in question was actually a Vue2 project. For those unfamiliar, Vue2 is out of support (EOS), making it a poor choice for any serious development work. It's baffling that a company would advertise using Vue + NestJS and then reveal they are using an outdated framework.

## Terrible Project Setup
To make matters worse, this was a sports betting project using one of the slowest frameworks available. Itâ€™s mind-blowing how a project in such a competitive and performance-critical domain could be so poorly chosen.

## Disorganized Interview Process
The interview process itself was a nightmare. I was interviewed by five people over the course of two hours. There was no outline or plan for the interview, making it a chaotic and unproductive session. Despite their high level of education, it was clear that none of them had a clue about how to conduct a proper technical interview.

## Neglected Project
The most shocking part was discovering that their project was left to rot, never updated, and highly susceptible to exploits. Itâ€™s disgusting that a group of supposedly skilled developers would let their project deteriorate to such a state. This level of neglect is inexcusable.

## Inadequate Coding Environment
During the interview, I was given a text editor with color coding and asked to write code that we couldn't even run or test (no lsp). It felt like they were expecting me to write code on a piece of toilet paper. How can a company expect to evaluate a developer's skills without a proper environment to run and test code?

Overall, the entire experience was a colossal waste of time. Iâ€™m incredibly relieved that this didnâ€™t turn into anything serious. If this interview was any indication of their work environment and project management skills, I dodged a bullet by not joining Happening.
